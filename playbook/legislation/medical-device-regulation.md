# MDR -	Medical Device Regulation

</br>

In May 2021 a new stricker regulation for medical devices (**Medical Device Regulation - MDR**) was taken in effect. The MDR applies to medical devices and products used for diagnoses and treatments in the healthcare sector or products that can help prevent or predict disease or disorders. These include devices like bandages, pacemakers and surgical instruments but also software like medical apps. Manufactures and developers of such medical devices most comply with the legal requirements of the MDR.

**Describe how this relates to data sharing**
<br?
In the MDR medical devices are classified according to the risk there is for the patient. In the MDR four categories are identified:
<br>
I- Medical devices with low risk
<br>
IIa - Medical devices with moderate risk
<br>
IIb - Medical devices with moderate to high risk
<br>
III - Medical devices that come into direct contact with the heart, the central circulatory system or the central nervous system

Clinical evaluation
Before you market a medical device, you need to do a medical evaluation. You perform laboratory tests on the safety of your product. In some cases you will need to conduct a clinical investigation. You must notify the Health and Youth Inspectorate (IGJ) of clinical research.

CE marking
Every medical device on the European market must have CE marking. CE marking means your product complies with the legal requirements. For Class I medical devices (non-sterile and/or non-measuring) you assess if the product complies with the Medical Devices Directive. If this is the case you may put the CE marking on the product.

Medical devices Class IIa, IIb and III must be inspected by an independent authority (Notified Body). If this authority approves the product you will receive a CE certificate. Only then are you allowed to market the medical device.
