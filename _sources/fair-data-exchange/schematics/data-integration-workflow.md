The **Data Integration Workflow** diagram describes the process level of the intake of FAIR data within an organisation. Data may be acquired internally or externally and may come in various formats. The _Data Steward_ is responsible for the policy and semantic-level handling of these data, while the _Information Manager_ is responsible for the secure and proper technical processing of data.

The steps of this workflow are as follows:

* Incoming & Existing Data
  * External data from data exchange, acquisition or open data sources are presented for validation and processing.
  * Internal data from business processes, monitoring and research entry are presented for validation and processing.  

* Validation
  * Verification that the data provider user or group has the right permissions to access the data integration service. 
  * Verification that the data adheres to the right structure and meets technical policies.

* Data Preperation
  * The data is evaluated for quality and semantic compability. 
  * The data is processed to meet technical specifications or format that is compatible with the system.

* Data Ingestion
  * Finally data is integrated with the backend systems.
